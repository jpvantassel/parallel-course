## Overview

This site includes introductory information to parallel programming using the
two most common programming models: `OpenMP` and `MPI`. The material for each
programming model is designed to be self-contained, meaning you are free to
begin with whichever you find more interesting. If you do not have a preference
I would recommend beginning with `OpenMP`.

To provide structure to each topic, both programming models are divided into
modules. Each module is designed to be relatively short and thoroughly cover one
specific topic. Try to understand each module before moving forward as later
modules will build upon concepts presented in earlier ones. So it is highly
recommended that you follow the modules in the order in which they are
listed.

Finally, please note that this course is still in the
construction stage so you can expect content to be added, removed, and
reorganized without notice. However, the `OpenMP` course, while not in its final
version, should contain the basics to get you started.

All the best,
